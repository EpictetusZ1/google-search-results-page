# Google Search Results Page for Chess
A clone of the Google 'Search Results' page. This is part of a project from 'The Odin Project'.

### Why Chess?
Well, I just happen to thoroughly enjoy playing, watching and learning about Chess. 

With that in mind, it is much more fun to work on a project that combines 2 things you are interested in (Chess and Coding).

### About
This project makes use of: 
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- Media queries
- Responsive Design *
- .svg elements

#### * Note: 
Mobile design is out of the scope for this assignment / project, therefore this is a desktop-only clone.
With exception of the "Result / Wiki Card" which does have a breakpoint to disappear when the screen size is too small.
